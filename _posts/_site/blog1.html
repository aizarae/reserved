    <h1> A Fresh Take on Something...</h1>
    <article>
        In this activity, I had the pleasure to be partnered with Leo Cordero, a fellow student minoring in this subject. We were able to discuss things past what the brief suggested and were able to dive into menial yet interesting topics. 

From the interview itself, I noticed some similarities in what Leo and I considered a high point in our lives. It was the time when we both realized we had bigger responsibilities to take but still had complete control over our decisions. I admired how he was able to own his duty as an older brother without a question. This kind of moment is not as grand as others but to both of us, this was a real improvement and a sign of growth. 

In terms of business innovations, Leo brought up a business called Overdoughs that employed deaf and mute scholars supported through College of Saint Benilde’s scholarship for deaf education. When Leo first discovered them, he spotted the signage educating buyers how to properly use sign language. Leo thinks that having a business with an advocacy, which has the capacity to  address diversity and inclusivity, can be a step towards equality.

In the future, Leo sees everyone pursuing their own ambitions without limit. Privilege and unequal opportunities are two of the things that people often cannot get because of certain circumstances. Ten years from now, Leo hopes for these to be eradicated. He also thinks that novel technologies would emerge, as can be seen in today’s trend. This continuous innovation can be a bridge in opening more opportunities for others as well as leveling the playing field.  

This interview has made me appreciate the more human aspects of people. It highlighted the possibilities of a healthy discourse between the interviewer and the interviewee. It has also taught me that even as individuals, we do have the same goals of having a better future, whether it be socially, environmentally, or economically.
